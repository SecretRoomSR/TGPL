# GLOX
## GLOX is currently in its early development, so dont expect much for now :)
GLOX is a free open-source designed to help beginners code in a blocky style.

Its powerful editor is capable of placing code blocks, erasing them, selecting them, and with of course many utility tools for you to use to make your life easier.

Your projects are also sharable with other people, and collaboration (future plan) is also a thing. So you can code with someone else in real-time.

## Modding (future plan)
Want a new code block to satisfy your desires? Then this feature is just for you, although you need to know on how to code using python. With this feature, you are able to make a mod in its in-app mod editor.

If you already know python, but dont know on how to code the mod, then you might need to visit the [modding documentation](https://github.com/SecretRoomSR/GLOX/blob/main/DOCS/MODDING.md)

## Future Plan
- Modding
- Collaboration
